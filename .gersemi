#
# To actually use gersemi, you need to install it in the host system
# (hamilton). The Debian Buster based docker images do not have all
# the Python dependencies (in our Python 3.8 package) to run it.
#
# $ pip3 install gersemi
#
# After that, add ~/.local/bin to your PATH:
#
# $ PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
#
# Run gersemi with the -i flag to modify in-place.
